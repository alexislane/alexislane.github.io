I was on my way back from Humboldt County to help out my friend Archie when I decided to stop at Mitchell Brothers O'Farell theater and see who was working. The first dancer who appeared was Alexis Lane. I was absolutely smitten at first sight as we had never met and I had no idea that a 22 year old colombian dancer with killer tattoos existed. I immediately asked her into a private room and we negotiated at $400 blowjob. I was so enamored with her beauty that we talked for 15 minutes and I never even got the blowjob. Then I ponied up another $200 and she sucked it like a pro for ten minutes. I decided to run back to my car in the garage and get another two thousand and see where things would go. Little did I know that I was about to be taken for a ride.

She held on to my sweatshirt which she said she liked the smokey smell from my campfire in Fort Bragg. I ran back to my car, grabbed the cash, thinking about her sweet ass the whole time. We jumped into a half hour room and we boned down. I don't usually like to have sex at MBOT but this girl was probably the hottest dancer I have ever been with. She bounced on my dick with a passion that gave me the impression that we were meant to be together. You see I do this thing were I fall in love with dancers in 15 minute intervals. Sometimes it lasts for hours or days or weeks. With Alexis it would last for almost six weeks. More to come on that. After the first $1000, I took a short break for a cigarette and then returned to get back at it. Another $1000 went like water and then I headed out with her work cell number in my phone. I knew I would see her again but I didn't know when.
