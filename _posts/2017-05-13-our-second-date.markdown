I spent most of the next week thinking about the hottest woman I had ever slept with. We texted a few times and she asked me to come back to the club on Saturday the 13th so I obliged. She even agreed to have dinner with me after her shift was over. You see I like to give dancers enough rope to hang themselves. A part of me wanted to become her boyfriend/pimp or captian save-a-hoe. I brought $7000 with me, booked a room at the Hotel Metropolis and figured that would be enough to keep both of us satisfied. Three more rooms at the club and I was satiated. I even paid her to masturbate for me with my eyes closed. True story. I walked over to Harris and she join me around 7pm when she got off work.

Dinner was lovely - surf and turf with a nice jazz band playing in the back ground. I bought her a bottle of wine and wrote her a short love note. Timshel which means thou mayest. It's about love and the choice between good and evil. We went back to my hotel and she pulled her first stunt. She claimed that her puppy needed to be let out and she had to return home immediately. Keep in mind that it was only about 9pm and I was ready for another round of banging. I argued with her and she kept asking for more money. So I generously gave her $2000 for the dinner date and sent her on her way. I should have known at this point that sometimes was up. But I decided to see how deep the rabbit hole went.
